Scientific Abstract
-------------------------
For my project, I chose to research the impact of country happiness scores on the production of billionaires. My goal in researching this area is to better understand how the environment can impact the wealth an individual amasses since I've always had an interest in the finance sector. The purpose of my research is to understand how happiness index scores such as freedom, health expectancy, generosity, corruption, and GDP can individually affect the rate, as well as which of the values has the highest influence. Though I couldn't find that much research on the WHR and Billionaire datasets, there were a few that studied this topic over a time range, rather than a snapshot of the current landscape. Within the two research papers, I found that discussed this topic, tax codes and rather simple relations were discussed and weren't that focused on the WHR. So for my project, I used many charts intended for static numbers such as scatter plots, treemaps, histograms, and box plots. To understand the impact of these values on whether the billionaire is self-made, the plots were often grouped by the binary self-made value. This specifically was useful in presenting what circumstances self-made billionaires thrive in. To show how the values are correlated, ordinary least square lines were used within the plots and proved to be extremely helpful in discussing the findings. The key findings in this research were the fact that countries with high freedom scores encouraged billionaires who are not self-made, while countries with high corruption scores didn't have a heavy impact on self-made billionaires. Overall, I'm interested in researching further into why countries with high freedom scores have a higher rate of billionaires who are not self-made.
