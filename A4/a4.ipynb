    "### 1. Research Question\n",
    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "<p>For my final project, I'd like to have an indepth analysis of the World Happiness Report (WHR) for the year 2020. I'd like to confirm my theory that if a country has a relatively happy population, then the country should be able to produce more billionaires and expect better GDP growth because happiness is linked to longer lifespans. </p>\n",

    "### 2. Background\n",
    "#### Billionaires, Millionaires, Inequality, and Happiness\n",
    "<p>After doing a couple searches on Google, I was able to find the research article \"Billionaires, Millionaires, Inequality, and Happiness\" by Vladimir Popov (published 2019). This article was an indepth analysis of the WHR data from the 2000s to 2018, and \"examined the relationship between income inequality and happiness\". The author comes to many conclusions, but one that stuck out to me was the finding that the \"most rapid growth in the number of self-made billionaires and in the growth in their wealth is East Asia\". This is important because I'd like to relate this to the happiness data to understand whether those countries usually have higher happiness and life satisfaction. Pertaining to whether a correlation exists between the amount of billionaires to happiness scores, the author found that they were positively correlated.</p>\n",
