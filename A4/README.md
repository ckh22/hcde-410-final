Project Details
For my final project in HCDE 410, I will use three datasets to compare GDP, health, and happiness and come up with visual illustrations of patterns in the data.

Though the datasets are very general at this point, I'll select a dataset to compare with the baseline of GDP, health, and happiness to make a black-white conclusion with, because the three should obviously be positively correlated

Motivation & Problem Statement

Why? In my report, I wanted to confirm whether countries with happier people will end up with higher health standards and GDP growth. Mainly, I'd like to add a portfolio piece that can emphasize my skills in visually communicating data to the user.
Interesting things about it? I thought this topic would be interesting because the datasets include from 2020 to 2014, so I'll have a good amount of data to make cool visualizations with (which I'm excited for). I could also pick another dataset to go along this, but I wanted to mainly focus on the global aspect due to how easy implementing a hash map is. Though the datasets aren't interesting on their own, combining multiple may create interesting patterns.
Goals? My goal is to be able to organize the data well, and become better at using the Pandas library. Additionally, I'd like to create indepth analysis on the three datasets I've selected by pointing out patterns among the graph. I don't believe the dataset is corrupted at all, since the rows are organized by country. The rating is also very good on Kaggle, and should be an interesting project to create visual representations with. Data Selected for analysis
Summarize dataset For my report, I selected three datasets: World Happiness Report, World Health Statistics, and GDP Annual Growth for Each Country. These three datasets include 264 unique countries, which include economic, happiness, and health data.

Explain why this dataset Includes many unique countries to create a map graph with. Plenty of data to make comparisons and analyze with.
Ethical concerns? None really, since a lot of the data is public domain. The datasets have very good ratings on Kaggle, and has been reused many times. Some of the datasets do have duplicate countries, but I will calculate the average among the regions, and hopefully that won't skew the results. Unknows and Dependencies
Factors that might make the project take longer or hard. None, I'll first implement a hash function to sort into the 264 countries with the information from the other two datasets merged correctly. I'll also spend a good amount of time reading the Plotly documentation, and perhaps also exploring another graphing python package.
